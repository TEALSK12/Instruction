# Crazy Job Interview

Each participant will take turns convincing another that they are the best for an imaginary job.

## The Twist

They have to talk about things suggested by the other participants, and explain why those things would make them a good fit for the job.

**For example,** One participant might have to explain why being an _Intellectual_ and _A My Little Pony Fan_ makes them a great _Supermodel_. The next participant might try to make a persuasive case that being _Aggressively Flirtatious_ and _Angry With The Queen_ makes them indispensable as _Prime Minister._

## Set Up

1. Give each participant seven small strips of paper.
2. Each participant writes down five or more “traits." Just an adjective will do — “Fast,” “Stupid,” “Corrupt,” or “Invisible,”

    * **for example** — but feel free to get creative. Maybe a background, such as “Irish,” or a previous job, such a “Bin Man,” or an interest, such as “Video Gamer,” or outlook on life, such as “Brexiteer".
3. Each participant writes down two or more “occupations." (Mundane or fantastical, it all works well.)
4. Randomly choose a participant. They will be the first interviewer.
5. The other participants draw an occupation and three traits from the respective hats and/or bowl.

    * **Note: They can look at the occupation, but not at the traits.**

6. In any order, the Regional Manager will call on one of the participants to be the interviewee.
7. The interviewee will be giving a short speech explaining why they are a fit for the job they have drawn.
8. At the same time, the interviewee looks at one of the their trait slips, and starts to give their speech.
    * The first part of their speech should revolve around this trait
    * If the occupation is “Doctor” and the trait is “Bloodlust,” the participant might say that they are far from squeamish about cutting people open, and that they can go into their job with a passion that other surgeons would lack.
9. When they are ready, the interviewee looks at their next trait, and begins talking about that trait instead.
    * The interviewer can force the interviewee to move on to the next trait. They say, “Okay, what else?". If the interviewee is talking about their last trait, the interviewer would instead say, “Okay, I’ve heard enough."
10. When the interviewee has finished talking about their three traits, the interviewer chooses another participant to give an interview.
11. The participant to left of the current interviewer becomes the new interviewer, and the game starts again.

## Notes

Not everyone is great at talking when on the spot. There is no need to try to be funny or creative in this game — just relax and say what comes to mind. If participants do need a moment to compose themselves, though, they can ask the interviewing participant to go last in that round.
