# Four Corners

## Directions

Announce a topic with four answer choices. Assign each answer choice to a corner of the room. On the moderator’s count, have each participant move to the appropriate corner. When all participants have chosen a corner either 1) give each small group a subtopic to discuss among themselves or 2) allow some (or all) of the participants in each corner to share with the large group about why they chose the answer in that corner.

### Remote Modifications

For Remote sessions, each participant will need permission to ‘Draw on whiteboard & annotations’. See the article ‘Set Participant Permissions’ in the Newrow Knowledge Base for more information. Participants will use their laser pointer (circled in red below) to choose a corner of the room. Laser pointers will have the participants name next to them.

Create a slide to represent the room - topic listed at the top, a four-quadrant grid with choices in each section. Continue with the directions as written above.  Have participants use their laser pointers to choose the corner that best represents their answer. Small group sharing is impractical with the current available tools.

### Example Topics

**Option 1:** Label the four corners of the room with large numbers, 1‐4.  Tell participants to listen to the characteristics you describe, and to go to the number that best describes them.

**An example question may be:**

Do you have siblings?  

* If you have 1 sibling, go to Corner 1.
* If you have 2 siblings, go to Corner 2.
* If you have 3 or more siblings, go to Corner 3.
* If you have no siblings, go to Corner 4.  

**Optional:** Once participants have moved to their corner, if your group is not incredibly large you can have them circle up and share on that topic.  For example, in participants could be instructed to share a time their sibling got on their nerves, and participants in the “no siblings” corner could share whether they like being an only child.

**Option 2:**  Label the four corners of the room with Strongly Agree, Agree, Disagree, Strongly Disagree.  Tell participants you will read a statement, and they are to go to the corner of the room that represents their opinion on that issue.  

**Example questions may be:**
For groups first getting to know one another, topics should be lighthearted and fun such as “Chocolate cake is the best dessert on the planet”. Once relationships in the group have been built, this activity can be used to discuss deeper topics in a kinesthetic way. An example is “School uniforms cut down on teasing, violence, and class disruptions”.
