# Crazy Job Interview

Each participant will take turns convincing another that they are the best for an imaginary job.

## The Twist

They have to talk about things suggested by the other participants and explain why those things would make them a good fit for the job.
For example: One participant might have to explain why being an Intellectual and A My Little Pony Fan makes them a great Supermodel. The next participant might try to make a persuasive case that being Allergic to Air and Angry makes them indispensable as a Soccer Coach.
Set Up

1. Each participant writes down seven or more “traits.”
    >Just an adjective will do — “Fast,” “Closed-Minded,” “Corrupt,” or “Invisible,” **For example** but feel free to get creative. Maybe a background, such as “Oldest Child,” or a previous job, such a “Delivery Person,” or an interest, such as “Video Gamer,” or outlook on life, such as “Minimalist”.
2. Each participant writes down three or more “occupations.” (Mundane or fantastical, it all works well.)
3. The Regional Manager will break participants into break out rooms so there are at least three participants in each breakout room.
4. After everyone is in the breakout room, randomly choose a participant. They will be the first interviewer.
5. The interviewer selects a number one through three (based on the number of occupations the interviewee has written) and a number one through seven (based on the number of traits the interviewee has written).
    >Note: Each interviewee will act out occupation and traits written on their own paper based on what the interviewer selects.
6. The interviewee will be giving a short speech explaining why they are a fit for the job they have drawn.
7. At the same time, the interviewee selects one of pre-selected trait slips, and starts to give their speech.
    >The first part of their speech should revolve around this trait
    If the occupation is “Doctor” and the trait is “Bloodlust,” the participant might say that they are far from squeamish about cutting people open, and that they can go into their job with a passion that other surgeons would lack.
8. When they are ready, the interviewee looks at their next trait, and begins talking about that trait instead.
    > The interviewer can force the interviewee to move on to the next trait. They say, “Okay, what else?”. If the interviewee is talking about their last trait, the interviewer would instead say, “Okay, I’ve heard enough.”
9. When the interviewee has finished talking about their three traits, the interviewer chooses another participant to give an interview.
10. The participant to left of the current interviewer becomes the new interviewer, and the game starts again.

## Notes

Not everyone is great at talking when on the spot. There is no need to try to be funny or creative in this game — just relax and say what comes to mind. If participants do need a moment to compose themselves, though, they can ask the interviewing participant to go last in that round.
